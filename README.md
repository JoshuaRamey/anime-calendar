(WIP) A TV Guide for anime to help viewers find something to watch and keep track of what's on.


UPDATE:
I changed the way that data is structured in the app. Due to this, search results now return broadcast info for each show (finally!). The main app functionality is now finished, all that's left is to redo the user interface. I drew the new design on paper and decided how I want it to look, now it's just a matter of coding it when I get a chance.

Info:
The purpose of this app is to serve as a TV guide for currently-airing anime. It's a work in progress and as such there are
some things that still need to be worked out. Currently the app needs a UX overhaul, so please excuse
the visual mess.
