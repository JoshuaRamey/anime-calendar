(WIP) A TV Guide for anime to help viewers find something to watch and keep track of what's on.

The purpose of this app is to serve as a TV guide for currently-airing anime. It's a work in progress and as such there are
some things that still need to be worked out, such as returning broadcast data for each show (I need to set up a server and cach the data). However I did have that
functionality working before pulling it due to the API request limit). Currently the app needs a UX overhaul, so please excuse
the visual mess.
