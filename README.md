Work in Progress

Description:
A side project in React.JS for anime fans to easily track the weekly schedule of currently-airing anime. Users can also search by genre and by name to find something to watch or find which day a show they are interested in airs.

Challenges:
I learned a lot from this project, such as how to use an API. The way that the API returned data was extremely inconvenient for this project and through that I learned how to reshape the data that has been returned from the API. I also learned how to filter data, separate components, and how to easily create one function that maps or filters through multiple objects depending on user input. This project challenged me in many areas and it felt very rewarding to overcome those challenges and learn the proper way to do some of these tasks.


UPDATE (June, 5):
All functionality of the app is now finished, at this point I'm working on making changes to the UX. The UX is far from finished so excuse it's ugliness for now. Some stuff in the code also needs to be renamed for clarity, and in general I'm going to go through the code and clean things up some more.
