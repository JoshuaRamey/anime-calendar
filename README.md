(WIP) A TV Guide for anime to help viewers find something to watch and keep track of what's on.

The purpose of this app is to serve as a TV guide for currently-airing anime. It's a work in progress and as such there are
some things that still need to be worked out, such as returning broadcast data for each show (I need to talk with the creator
of the API for this, as currently doing so exceeds to amount of requests allowed for this free API. However I did have that
functionality working before pulling it due to the API request limit). Currently the app needs a UX overhaul, so please excuse
the visual mess.
