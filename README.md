(WIP) A TV Guide for anime to help viewers find something to watch and keep track of what's on.

The purpose of this app is to serve as a TV guide for currently-airing anime. It's a work in progress and as such there are
some things that still need to be worked out. Currently the app needs a UX overhaul, so please excuse
the visual mess.


UPDATE (June, 5):
All functionality of the app is now finished, at this point I'm working on making changes to the UX. The UX is far from finished so excuse it's ugliness for now. Some stuff in the code also needs to be renamed for clarity, and in general I'm going to go through the code and clean things up some more.
