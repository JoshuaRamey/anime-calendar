# anime-calendar
Work in Progress

Description:
A side project in React.JS for anime fans to easily track the weekly schedule of currently-airing anime. Users can also search by genre to find something to watch or by name to find which day a show they are interested in airs.

Challenges:
I learned a lot from this project, such as how to use an API. The way that the API returned data was extremely inconvenient for this project and through that I learned how to reshape the data that has been returned from the API. I also learned how to filter data, separate components, and how to easily create one function that maps or filters through multiple objects depending on user input. Later on, while making changes to the project I learned how to use functional components in React as opposed to the standard class components. This project challenged me in many areas and it felt very rewarding to overcome those challenges and learn the proper way to do some of these tasks.

UPDATE (June 12):
The app is mostly done at this point, I'm looking for little areas where my code can be improved upon, such as things that I missed when making changes to or updating various functions or components. There's one small bug I'm hunting for as well.
